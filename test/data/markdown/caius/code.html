<p>Now we are going to test fenced code Blocks:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.tcl}">package require Itcl
package require Testing

::itcl::class MyTest {
    inherit ::Testing::TestObject

    method test1 {} {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now using backticks:</p>

<pre><code class="language-tcl">
package require Itcl
package require Testing

::itcl::class MyTest {
    inherit ::Testing::TestObject

    method test1 {} {}
}

</code></pre>
